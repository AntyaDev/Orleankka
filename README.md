Orleankka is a complementary API for Microsoft Orleans framework. Orleankka's API is based on [message passing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Message_passing) style of communication. Orleankka was developed specifically for scenarios, where having a uniform communication interface would payoff in terms of reduced code repetition (DRY, SRP) and respectively, increased code clarity. The API was thoroughly crafted to be as convenient to use from both, imperative object-oriented languages, like C#, as well as from functional, such as F#.

### Why?

Out-of-the box, Microsoft Orleans comes with static code generator and support for non-uniform custom interfaces, very similar to WCF. This approach fits nicely into an object-oriented paradigm and is good enough for majority of applications and use-cases.

Unfortunately, it doesn't play well when combined with [Event Sourcing](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dn589792.aspx) approach to state persistence. An interplay between non-uniform and uniform interface leads to code duplication and is generally error-prone. That can be remedied by introduction of a catch-all function, where all requests received by an actor could be intercepted (AOP). Sadly, but such highly useful higher-order function is not exposed by the framework.   

Orleankka is an attempt to fix that problem in a generic way. It turned out that introduction of uniform communication interface, also fixed a lot of other small-to-medium annoyances, constraints and even some of the major limitations, present in current Orleans programming model.

### Goals

- __No sacrifices__. Full feature parity with native Orleans api and more.
- __Side-by-side execution__. Can mix uniform actors with native Orleans' grains.
- __Simplicity__. For both simple and complex scenarios.
- __Designed for testability__. Inversion of control - you drive the framework.  
- __Annoyance-free__. Eliminate noise induced by Orleans' native programming model.
- __Low friction__. Within syntax limits of major programming languages (C#/F#).
